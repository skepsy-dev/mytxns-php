            <p>Hi Fam - <br><br>
                    How are you? Thank you for visiting. Iâ€™m a amateur programmer that started my coding journey a few months ago. With that said,
                please bear with me for I know the site is very basic at the moment. However, I have many ideas for improvement from editing to twitter
                API's and much more to help you track projects before and after mint. My goal is to provide simple, easy to read tools 
                that can save time and help you organize. Personally, I've had enough of searching servers for forgotten infomation and 
                safe links while trying to use notes to list upcoming projects. It's time for useful tools that streamline the process 
                and maybe make life a little bit easier. I hope you find great use from these simple apps and please feel free to reach 
                out on twitter for questions or comments.
                <br><br>
                ps. more apps to be revealed. !ooh
